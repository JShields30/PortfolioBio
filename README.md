# PortfolioBio-
This is my website that contains an about me page, a portfolio page with all of my top projects I have created so far, and a contact page with my linked in, github, email, and telephone number. 

The purpose of this site is to show my skill level.

The deployed site is https://jshields30.github.io/PortfolioBio/

This site uses bootstrap frameworks, navbar, forms, and font awesome icons.
